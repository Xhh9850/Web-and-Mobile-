                Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action RPG that's set in the world of Teyvat, home to seven different nations. Mondstadt and Liyue were first to be unlocked, and now, thanks to Version 2.0, you can also explore Inazuma, once you've completed the requirements.
                You'll take on the role of either Lumine or Aether, separated twins who are both referred to as Traveler. As they explore Teyvat, searching for information about their twin, Traveler soon becomes embroiled in the affairs of both mortals and Gods, along with their newfound companion, Paimon.
                While the game is free to download and play, weapons and characters are acquired using a Gacha system. Since your desired characters can be difficult to acquire, we also have a guide about re-rolling to get better starter characters, as well as information about a Summon Simulator, which gives you an insight into your chances of pulling the characters and weapons you want without the monetary commitment.
